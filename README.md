# EventTrackerProject
This basic app uses REST API to perform CRUD OPERATIONS
###Description
Through this app, a user will be able to Create, Read, Update, and Delete all in the browser through the use of JavaScript. This means that all actions and changes within the browser use a REST/MVC backend and JavaScript front-end to display the interface and data to the user

###Technologies Used
* Spring Boot MVC
* JPA
* Gradle
* Java POJO
* Object Mapping
* REST API
* JavaScript

###Lessons Learned
JavaScript functionality makes it much easier to make and test changes within the browser. When combined with XHR/XMLRequests to query the API, this allows for a quick reactive front-end for the user.
